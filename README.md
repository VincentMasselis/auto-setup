# auto-setup
Just a SH script to install every tool I need when I prepare a new Mac machine

## How to use
Just run this into your terminal:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VincentMasselis/auto-setup/main/android.sh)"
```

Replace the file `android.sh` by the one you looking for.
